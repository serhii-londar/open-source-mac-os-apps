## Description
mxMarkEdit is a free software for Mac for writing texts and todo items in Markdown format and easily exporting them to other formats with Pandoc. In each document, it’s available an Excel-like grid useful to manage various sets of data. Some Markdown markers are hidden, as the text that follows them or is contained within them is properly formatted. At the left of the text, there’s a list of the titles and todo items. By clicking on an item in this list, the cursor moves to the corresponding title or todo item. While moving the cursor in the text, the corresponding title or todo item is highlighted. The app has many functionalities and shortcuts to manage easily a document.
 
## Why it should be included to `Awesome macOS open source applications ` (optional)
