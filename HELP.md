Hey , i apologise if my PR doesn't help you out as you need . I just started to learn coding and using Github or any OS platform for that matter but 
i have a few ideas you could change for your website .

1) Main Page - You should use the main page as a way of telling the user who you are , what this website is used for and where do you think
               this project will go ( like your goal for this project ) .

2) Tabs - I was thinking if you could add tabs in the orange space at the top of the website with all of the categories such as :

          Join Us | Development | Downloader | Editors | Utilities | Support Us | 
          
          as this will reduce the amount of items on the main page and keep everything in order and easier accessibility .
          
3) Description -  You could give the user a bit of information of what is what , say on the main page you've given a list of languages 
                  used to develop apps on MacOs . You could give a bit of information of each language , it's creators and examples of apps
                  developed using these languages .
                  
4) Logo - You can add the logo on the top orange bar as if the user navigates through your website using the tabs , they can come to the 
          main webpage by clicking on your logo .
          


These are my suggestions for your website , i hope this helps and i apologise for not contributing via coding as i've just started to learn c++ , 
but i hope this helps and all the best for your project.
